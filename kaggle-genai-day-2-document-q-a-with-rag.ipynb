If you are having any issues, please [check out the troubleshooting steps there](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting#Get-started-with-Kaggle-notebooks).\n\nTwo big limitations of LLMs are 1) that they only \"know\" the information that they were trained on, and 2) that they have limited input context windows. A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n\n1. Indexing\n2. Retrieval\n3. Generation\n\nIndexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.\n\nIn this notebook you will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. You will use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma, you can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search your documents.\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n","metadata":{"id":"CsVPnR8VbXE6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup\n\nFirst, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.","metadata":{"id":"akuOzK4dJl3j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip uninstall -qqy jupyterlab kfp  # Remove unused conflicting packages\n!pip install -qU \"google-genai==1.7.0\" \"chromadb==0.6.3\"","metadata":{"id":"JbXe7Oodc5dP","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-01T09:48:03.084216Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-01T09:48:03.084919Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-01T09:48:36.838767Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-01T09:48:03.084880Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-01T09:48:36.837528Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from google import genai\nfrom google.genai import types\n\nfrom IPython.display import Markdown\n\ngenai.__version__","metadata":{"id":"muuhsDmmKdHi","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-01T09:48:36.841243Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-01T09:48:36.842113Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-01T09:48:37.860639Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-01T09:48:36.842062Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-01T09:48:37.859694Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":3,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'1.7.0'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Set up your API key\n\nTo run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a [Kaggle secret](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/114053) named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n\nIf you don't already have an API key, you can grab one from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
