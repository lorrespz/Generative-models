You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompting using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n## New for Gemini 2.0!\n\nThis course material was first launched in November 2024. The AI and LLM space is moving incredibly fast, so we have made some updates to use the latest models and capabilities.\n\n* These codelabs have been updated to use the Gemini 2.0 family of models.\n* The Python SDK has been updated from `google-generativeai` to the new, unified [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai) SDK.\n  * This new SDK works with both the developer Gemini API as well as Google Cloud Vertex AI, and switching is [as simple as changing some fields](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/#:~:text=.Client%28%29-,API%20Selection,-By%20default%2C%20the).\n* New model capabilities have been added to the relevant codelabs, such as \"thinking mode\" in this lab.\n* Day 1 includes a new [Evaluation codelab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output).","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with the Gemini API\n\nAll of the exercises in this notebook will use the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) by way of the [Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/).

Her life revolved around the plush cushions of Mrs. Higgins' armchair and the rhythmic purr of the ancient grandfather clock in the hall. Adventure was for the birds she stalked (unsuccessfully) in the garden, not for a dignified feline like herself.\n\nUntil the butterfly.\n\nIt wasn’t just any butterfly. This one was a monarch, its wings a stained-glass window of orange and black. It flitted past the open window, a beacon in Clementine’s otherwise predictable world. Curiosity, a sensation usually reserved for the rustling of treat bags, surged within her. With a daring leap, she landed on the windowsill and then, against all her feline instincts, she jumped.\n\nThe world outside Mrs. Higgins' garden was a symphony of unfamiliar smells and sounds. The scent of damp earth mingled with exhaust fumes, a jarring contrast to the rose-scented air she was accustomed to. She followed the butterfly, its erratic flight path leading her down a cobblestone path she'd never seen before.\n\nThe path twisted and turned, revealing hidden alleyways and forgotten courtyards. Clementine, usually a creature of comfort, found herself strangely invigorated. She scaled brick walls, narrowly escaping a grumpy-looking bulldog, and navigated a cacophony of honking cars and chattering pedestrians.\n\nFinally, the butterfly landed on a vibrant mural, a riot of color depicting fantastical creatures and swirling landscapes. Clementine paused, mesmerized. This wasn't just a wall; it was a portal to another world.\n\nAs she gazed at the mural, a small, brown kitten emerged from behind a overflowing dumpster, its fur matted and its eyes wide with fear. Clementine, usually dismissive of younger felines, felt a pang of sympathy. She nudged the kitten gently, then, with a surprisingly motherly chirp, led it towards the warm sunbeam bathing the mural.\n\nThey sat together, the seasoned adventurer and the frightened stray, bathed in the light of the painted sun. The monarch butterfly, its mission accomplished, fluttered away, disappearing into the bustling city.\n\nClementine knew she couldn't take the kitten back to Mrs. Higgins, who was, sadly, \"not a cat person.\" But she also couldn't leave it alone. She would find it shelter, a kind human, a home. \n\nSuddenly, the adventure had changed. It wasn't just about chasing a butterfly; it was about something more. It was about using her newfound courage and resourcefulness to make the world a little kinder, a little brighter, for another creature in need. Clementine, the champion napper, had become Clementine, the champion. Her journey home, though longer, felt lighter, filled with a purpose she never knew she possessed. The sunbeam on Mrs. Higgins' armchair would feel even warmer after this.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

It sets up a `PROMPT_COMMAND` which is executed before each prompt is displayed.\n\nIn essence, it's a utility script that makes your command-line prompt \"Git-aware,\" increasing your productivity when working with Git repositories.\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":34},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nBe sure to check out the codelabs on day 3 too, where you will explore some more advanced prompting with code execution.\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!\n\n*- [Mark McD](https://linktr.ee/markmcd)*","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}}]}
